## 🧠 1. Project Overview

Telecom companies lose **millions of dollars every year due to customer churn**. Understanding *who is likely to leave* and **why** is crucial for customer retention. This project builds a **multimodal AI system** to address this challenge by combining structured and unstructured data analysis.

- **Structured Data Analysis:** Utilizes traditional Machine Learning (ML) models (e.g., XGBoost) on customer demographics, service usage, and billing information to predict the likelihood of churn.
- **Unstructured Data Analysis:** Employs Deep Learning (DL) models (e.g., CNN + BiLSTM + Attention) for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of customer feedback text.
- **Multimodal Fusion:** The system is designed to integrate the outputs of both models to provide a more robust and explainable prediction of customer behavior.

The final outcome is a **deployable AI pipeline** ready for integration into real-world telecom CRM and decision-making systems.

---

## ❗ 2. Problem Statement

- Customers leave telecom services due to **billing confusion**, **poor support**, or **network issues**.
- Business teams **lack AI-driven tools** to analyze customer feedback + behavior together.
- Manual CRM analysis is **slow**, **biased**, and **reactive**, instead of **proactive**.

> **The core question addressed by this project is:** Can an AI system effectively detect early churn indicators AND provide a clear explanation of *why* customers are leaving by synthesizing insights from both structured service data and unstructured feedback text?

This project demonstrates that a **combined ML + DL system** can successfully achieve this goal.

---

## 🎯 3. Objectives and Outcomes
